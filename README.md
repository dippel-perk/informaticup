# Genetic Algorithm for a Query Efficient Input-free Black-box Attack against a Neural Network with Limited Information

Previous work has shown that neural networks can be fooled by adversarial images. As part of the informaticup competition, we investigate a black box attack scenario where only limited query access (60 queries per minute) and partial output (top five classes) is given. This tool implements a genetic algorithm, which is capable of generating adversarial images which fool the target network.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

* Python version `>= 3.5`
* Install packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`



## Usage

Depending on your configuration you might have to replace the `python` command with `python3`. You can check if `python` executes the correct version with the following command

```
$ python --version
Python 3.5.x
```

To change the `python` command you can place an alias into `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_aliases` files

```
alias python=python3
```

The program can be run by

`python main.py`
